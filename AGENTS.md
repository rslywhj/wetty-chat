## Project Overview

wetty-chat is a chat application targeting ~20k users / ~10k messages per day. It has a **Rust backend** (Axum + Diesel/PostgreSQL) and a **React frontend** (Ionic + Vite).

## SubAgents
The project is relatively large and complex, so use subagents to explore the project
unless you know for sure there are limited files to look and you know which ones.

## Planning
If the user is asking you to implement a feature or fix some bug, then before making
changes always produce at least a high level overview of what you want to change.
It should at least cover:
    - What is the problem
    - What is the change you want to put in at a high level
    - Is this a quick patch to get the problem resolved or the best design given our requirements
